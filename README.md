## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and analysis of an SSH honeypot to gather threat intelligence on automated attacks. The honeypot captures attacker behavior, credential attempts, and post-compromise activities in a controlled, isolated environment.

**Why this matters:** Understanding real-world attack patterns is crucial for developing effective defensive strategies. This project provides hands-on experience with threat intelligence gathering and attack analysis.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Honeypot Software**: Cowrie medium-interaction SSH honeypot
- **Environment**: Isolated VM lab with dual network adapters (NAT + Host-Only)
- **Security Controls**: Network segmentation, UFW firewall, non-root execution
- **Port Management**: Linux capabilities for privileged port binding
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logging and complete session capture

## 🚀 Implementation Highlights

- ✅ **Production Deployment**: SSH honeypot running on standard port 22
- ✅ **Realistic Environment**: Convincing Linux filesystem with business context
- ✅ **Security Hardening**: Proper user separation and network isolation
- ✅ **Professional Setup**: Following cybersecurity best practices

## 📊 Intelligence Collection
