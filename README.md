# SSH Honeypot Threat Analysis

> A medium-interaction SSH honeypot deployment for capturing and analyzing real-world attack patterns in isolated lab environment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and analysis of an SSH honeypot to gather threat intelligence on automated attacks. The honeypot captures attacker behavior, credential attempts, and post-compromise activities in a controlled environment.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Honeypot**: Cowrie medium-interaction SSH honeypot
- **Environment**: Isolated VM lab with dual network adapters
- **Security**: Network segmentation, non-root execution, capability-based port binding
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logging and attack session recording

## 🚀 Key Features

- [x] Production-ready SSH honeypot on port 22
- [x] Realistic Linux filesystem simulation
- [x] Real-time attack logging and session capture
- [x] Network isolation with controlled internet access
- [x] Automated attack pattern analysis

## 📊 Attack Intelligence Gathered

- **[X] total attack sessions** captured over [timeframe]
- **Top 3 credential combinations** attempted
- **Geographic distribution** of attack sources
- **Common post-compromise activities** observed

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Virtualization**: VirtualBox
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu Server 22.04
- **Honeypot Software**: Cowrie
- **Network Security**: iptables, UFW firewall
- **Analysis Tools**: Python, Bash scripting
