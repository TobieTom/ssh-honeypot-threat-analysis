# Attack Pattern Analysis

> Analysis of SSH brute force attack patterns captured by the honeypot, demonstrating threat intelligence extraction and behavioral analysis skills.

## Executive Summary

Through 4 minutes of controlled honeypot operation, I captured and analyzed 45+ distinct attack events representing systematic SSH brute force campaigns. The analysis reveals sophisticated automated attack tools, predictable credential testing patterns, and clear defensive indicators that can be used for threat detection.

**Key Intelligence:**
- **100% automation detected** - No human interaction observed
- **Professional tools identified** - Hydra framework with distinctive signatures
- **Critical vulnerability exploited** - Weak root password enabled immediate compromise
- **Systematic methodology observed** - Consistent attack patterns across multiple rounds

## Attack Methodology Analysis

### Phase 1: Tool Identification

**Primary Attack Framework: Hydra SSH Brute Force Tool**

The logs consistently show specific signatures that identify the attack tool:

```
SSH Client Version: SSH-2.0-libssh_0.11.2
Client Fingerprint: 742b4fd5532ca4f243aae081017fe8c5
```

**Why this matters for defense:**
- These signatures can be used to create detection rules
- Consistent fingerprinting indicates automated tooling
- Version string helps identify attack tool updates
- Can be blocked at firewall level if desired

**What this tells us about the attacker:**
- Uses professional penetration testing tools
- Likely has cybersecurity knowledge (Hydra is industry standard)
- Prefers automated over manual approaches
- May be conducting reconnaissance or testing multiple targets

### Phase 2: Target Selection Strategy

**Primary Account Targeting Pattern:**

1. **root** (highest privilege account) - **SUCCESSFUL**
2. **admin** (administrative alternative) - Failed
3. **backup** (service account) - Failed

**Attack Intelligence:**
- Attackers prioritize administrative access
- Systematic testing of common administrative usernames
- Professional understanding of Linux account hierarchies
- No time wasted on low-privilege accounts

**This pattern indicates:**
- Attackers want immediate administrative control
- Suggests intent for lateral movement or data exfiltration
- Professional approach rather than casual exploration
- Understanding of typical server account structures

### Phase 3: Credential Attack Analysis

**Password Dictionary Pattern:**

Based on captured attempts, the attackers used this credential sequence:

1. `password` - **SUCCESSFUL** (most common weak password)
2. `123456` - Failed (top weak password globally)
3. `admin` - Failed (username-based password)
4. `root` - Failed (system-related password)
5. `password123` - Failed (common variation)
6. `qwerty` - Failed (keyboard pattern)
7. `letmein` - Failed (plain text request)
8. `welcome` - Failed (default system greeting)
9. `changeme` - Failed (default placeholder)

**Intelligence Insights:**
- Dictionary represents "top 10 most common passwords"
- No sophisticated password generation
- Relies on administrator laziness/poor security practices
- Standard penetration testing wordlist

**Success Factor Analysis:**
The attack succeeded because:
- Root account used extremely weak password
- No account lockout policies
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts
- No multi-factor authentication

## Technical Attack Analysis

### Connection Behavior Patterns

**Parallel Attack Strategy:**
```
Multiple simultaneous connections: 2-4 concurrent sessions
Attack rate: ~1.5 passwords per second
Session duration: 0.1-5.1 seconds average
```

**What this reveals:**
- **Efficiency focus** - Attackers optimize for speed
- **Resource awareness** - Limited connections to avoid detection
- **Professional approach** - Balanced speed vs. stealth
- **Automation confirmation** - Consistent timing patterns

### Network Protocol Analysis

**SSH Cryptographic Negotiation:**
```
Key Exchange: curve25519-sha256 with ssh-ed25519
Encryption: aes256-ctr 
Integrity: hmac-sha2-256
```

**Security implications:**
- Attackers use strong cryptography (ironic given weak passwords)
- Modern SSH protocol compliance
- No attempt to exploit cryptographic weaknesses
- Focus on authentication bypass rather than protocol attacks

### Session Behavior Analysis

**Post-Authentication Patterns:**

**Successful sessions (root account):**
- **Duration:** 0.1 seconds
- **Actions:** Immediate logout
- **Behavior:** Pure credential validation

**Failed sessions (admin/backup accounts):**
- **Duration:** 4.1-5.1 seconds  
- **Actions:** Systematic password testing
- **Behavior:** Exhaustive dictionary attack

**What this tells us:**
- Attackers confirm credential validity before proceeding
- No immediate malicious activity (credential harvesting phase)
- Professional operational security (quick verification)
- Likely part of larger reconnaissance campaign

## Timing and Persistence Analysis

### Attack Cycle Patterns

**Observed Attack Schedule:**
```
Round 1: 19:44:35 - Root account testing (successful)
Round 2: 19:44:37 - Admin account testing (failed)  
Round 3: 19:45:15 - Backup account testing (failed)
Total Duration: ~40 seconds active attacking
```

**Pattern Intelligence:**
- **Systematic approach** - Each account tested thoroughly
- **Reasonable delays** - Not aggressive enough to trigger basic DoS protection
- **Persistent methodology** - Continued despite initial success
- **Comprehensive testing** - Multiple account types targeted

**What this suggests about attacker goals:**
- Not just looking for any access (continued after root success)
- Possibly building comprehensive credential database
- May be testing honeypot detection capabilities
- Professional penetration testing methodology

## Behavioral Analysis

### Automation vs. Human Indicators

**Clear Automation Signals:**
- Consistent timing between attempts
- Identical SSH client signatures
- No interactive command execution
- Systematic password progression
- Immediate disconnection patterns

**No Human Behavior Observed:**
- No typing delays or variations
- No command exploration or curiosity
- No adaptive behavior based on responses
- No trial-and-error learning

**Confidence Level:** 99% automated attack

### Sophistication Assessment

**Professional Indicators:**
- Industry-standard attack tools (Hydra)
- Proper SSH protocol implementation
- Systematic target enumeration
- Efficient parallel connection strategy
- Clean operational security (quick exits)

**Basic Indicators:**
- Simple password dictionary
- No advanced evasion techniques
- No zero-day exploits attempted
- Standard penetration testing approach

**Assessment:** Professional tools, basic methodology

## Threat Intelligence Implications

### Attack Attribution

**Likely Attacker Profile:**
- **Skill Level:** Intermediate (professional tools, basic techniques)
- **Resources:** Standard penetration testing framework
- **Motivation:** Credential harvesting or system access
- **Sophistication:** Automated but not advanced persistent threat
- **Scale:** Likely scanning multiple targets systematically

### Defensive Recommendations

**Immediate Countermeasures:**
1. **Strong Password Policy** - Eliminate dictionary passwords
2. **Account Lockout** - Implement after 3-5 failed attempts
3. **Rate Limiting** - Restrict authentication attempts per IP
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Eliminate password-only authentication
5. **SSH Key Authentication** - Replace password authentication entirely

**Detection Rules:**
```bash
# Detect Hydra SSH attacks
SSH_CLIENT_VERSION = "SSH-2.0-libssh_0.11.2"
CLIENT_FINGERPRINT = "742b4fd5532ca4f243aae081017fe8c5"
RAPID_AUTH_FAILURES > 5 per minute
MULTIPLE_CONCURRENT_SSH > 2 connections
```

**Monitoring Alerts:**
- Multiple rapid SSH connections from single IP
- High authentication failure rates
- Short session durations with no commands
- Specific SSH client version strings
