# ================================================================
# ANALYSIS SUMMARY
# ================================================================

# Tool Identification:
# - SSH Client: libssh_0.11.2 (Hydra framework signature)
# - Fingerprint: 742b4fd5532ca4f243aae081017fe8c5 (consistent across all connections)
# - Method: Parallel brute force with systematic credential testing

# Attack Pattern:
# - Target Accounts: root (successful), admin (failed), backup (failed)
# - Password Dictionary: password, 123456, admin, root, password123, qwerty, letmein, welcome, changeme
# - Connection Strategy: Multiple parallel sessions for efficiency
# - Timing: ~1.5 passwords per second, 4-5 second total duration per account

# Success Factors:
# - Root account weakness: accepted common password "password"
# - No rate limiting: allowed rapid authentication attempts
# - No account lockout: permitted exhaustive dictionary testing

# Defensive Indicators:
# - SSH version string: SSH-2.0-libssh_0.11.2
# - Client fingerprint: 742b4fd5532ca4f243aae081017fe8c5
# - Connection rate: Multiple rapid connections to port 22
# - Authentication failure rate: High volume of failed attempts
# - Session duration: Very short (0.1-5.1 seconds) indicating automation

# Intelligence Value:
# This log sample demonstrates realistic automated SSH brute force attacks
# using professional penetration testing tools. The patterns shown are
# representative of real-world threats against SSH services globally.
