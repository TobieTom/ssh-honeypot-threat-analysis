# Attack Log Samples

> Sanitized examples of real attack data captured by the SSH honeypot, demonstrating threat intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities.

## Overview

This directory contains carefully selected and sanitized examples of the attack data I captured during my honeypot operation. These logs represent real automated attacks that demonstrate common SSH brute force patterns and attacker behavior.

**Important:** All IP addresses, timestamps, and sensitive identifiers have been sanitized for privacy and security while preserving the analytical value of the data.

## Log File Structure

### File Organization

### Data Sanitization

**What I removed or modified:**
- Real IP addresses → Replaced with lab network IPs (192.168.243.x)
- Actual timestamps → Normalized to show relative timing
- System-specific identifiers → Genericized while maintaining analytical value
- Personal or identifying information → Completely removed

**What I preserved:**
- Attack patterns and methodologies
- Tool signatures and fingerprints
- Credential attempt sequences
- Session durations and behaviors
- Command execution patterns

## Attack Intelligence Summary

### Tools Identified

**Primary Attack Tool:** Hydra SSH brute force framework
- **Signature:** SSH client version libssh_0.11.2
- **Fingerprint:** 742b4fd5532ca4f243aae081017fe8c5
- **Behavior:** Parallel connection strategy with systematic credential testing

**Reconnaissance Tool:** Nmap network scanner
- **Scan types:** TCP SYN scan with service detection
- **Timing:** Pre-attack reconnaissance followed by targeted exploitation
- **Information gathering:** Port status, service versions, OS detection

### Attack Patterns Observed

**1. Reconnaissance Phase**
```
Duration: 0.5-2 seconds per scan
Technique: TCP port scanning
Target: Port 22 (SSH service)
Information: Service version, OS fingerprinting
```

**2. Credential Attack Phase**
```
Duration: 4-6 seconds per account
Technique: Dictionary-based brute force
Rate: ~1.5 passwords per second
Parallelism: 2-4 simultaneous connections
```

**3. Post-Compromise Phase**
```
Duration: 0.1-5 seconds per session
Commands: ls, pwd, cat /etc/passwd, whoami
Objective: System reconnaissance and privilege assessment
```

### Credential Intelligence

**Most Targeted Usernames:**
1. `root` (administrative access)
2. `admin` (alternative administrative account)
3. `backup` (service account targeting)

**Common Password Attempts:**
1. `password` (successful against root)
2. `123456` (most common weak password)
3. `admin` (username-based password)
4. `root` (system-related password)
5. `password123` (common variation)

### Timing Analysis

**Attack Intervals:**
- Reconnaissance scans: Every 15-45 seconds
- Brute force attempts: Immediate following reconnaissance
- Session duration: 0.1-5.1 seconds average
- Total attack cycles: 5 rounds over 4 minutes

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- Automated timing patterns (no human variance)
- Systematic methodology (consistent tool usage)
- Professional approach (proper error handling)
- Persistence (multiple attack rounds)

## Defensive Intelligence

### Detection Signatures

**Network Level:**
- Multiple rapid connections to port 22
- SSH protocol version string: SSH-2.0-libssh_0.11.2
- Client fingerprint: 742b4fd5532ca4f243aae081017fe8c5
- Connection rate exceeding normal interactive SSH usage

**Authentication Level:**
- Rapid authentication attempts (multiple per second)
- Dictionary-based password patterns
- Common username targeting (root, admin, backup)
- High authentication failure rates

**Session Level:**
- Very short session durations
- Immediate system reconnaissance commands
- No interactive behavior (purely automated)
- Rapid disconnection after failed attempts

### Recommended Countermeasures

**Based on observed attack patterns:**

1. **Rate Limiting:** Implement connection rate limits (fail2ban)
2. **Strong Authentication:** Require complex passwords or key-based auth
3. **Account Lockout:** Temporary lockout after failed attempts
4. **Monitoring:** Alert on rapid authentication failures
5. **Network Filtering:** Restrict SSH access to known networks

## Technical Analysis Notes

### Log Format Understanding

**Cowrie log structure:**
```
TIMESTAMP [CONNECTION_ID,SOURCE_IP] EVENT_TYPE: EVENT_DETAILS
```

**Key fields for analysis:**
- **Timestamp:** Attack timing and patterns
- **Connection ID:** Session tracking and correlation
- **Source IP:** Attack source identification (sanitized)
- **Event Type:** Attack phase and methodology
- **Event Details:** Specific attack actions and results

### Analysis Methodology

**Pattern Recognition:**
1. Group events by connection ID for session analysis
2. Analyze timing patterns for automation detection
3. Correlate authentication attempts for credential analysis
4. Track command sequences for behavioral analysis

**Threat Classification:**
- **Automated vs. Manual:** Timing consistency analysis
- **Sophisticated vs. Basic:** Tool identification and methodology
- **Targeted vs. Opportunistic:** Reconnaissance depth and persistence
